Chronos Playbook for Ansible

This playbook will install Chronos and relies on the Mesos playbook.

Support open source!

NOTE: This role requires NodeJS installed! I've supplied it to galaxy as
`ansible-nodejs`. I'm not a fan of specifying a dependency without a
version, thus I've removed them from `meta/main.yml`.
